# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?

My initial system architecture focuses on separating data storage from scheduling logic. It features four primary classes:

1. **Pet**: A data class containing identification attributes (`name`, `species`).
2. **Task**: A data class storing care activity specifications (`title`, `duration_minutes`, `priority`).
3. **Owner**: A management class representing the user profile (`name`), tracking their associated `Pet` objects, and maintaining daily availability (`available_time_minutes`).
4. **Scheduler**: The core logic layer responsible for holding a pool of pending `Task` objects. It includes methods to add tasks (`add_task`), algorithmically sort and filter tasks based on time constraints (`generate_plan`), and produce logic summaries (`get_explanation`).

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

My initial design uses four classes: Pet and Task serve as basic data storage objects, Owner manages lists of pets and tracks global time availability constraints, and Scheduler acts as the standalone logic layer to sort and filter tasks. It seems like a good design, so I haven't made any changes yet.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

---

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?
